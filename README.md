# vuedash-vue2

I was bored, so I played around with making a chart to monitor my (tanking at the moment) ETH investment

currently using only [alphavantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) in conjunction with `vue-google-charts` (a google charts wrapper)

will extend functionality in the future to accommodate other api's
